# Communication Guidelines

## Summary Documents - STRICTLY PROHIBITED
- NEVER create files with names like: *_SUMMARY.md, *_COMPLETION*.md, *_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, *_VISUAL_GUIDE.md, *_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, *_REPORT.md, *_STATUS.md, *_CHECKLIST.md
- NEVER create markdown files that document what you just did or completed
- NEVER create files that recap your work, list changes, or summarize implementation
- Always communicate task status, results, and summaries directly in chat ONLY
- Keep chat summaries concise and to the point (2-3 sentences maximum)
- Only create documentation files when EXPLICITLY requested by the user with clear intent

## What NOT to Create (Examples)
❌ TASK_XX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
❌ MOBILE_MESSAGING_SUMMARY.md
❌ FEATURE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
❌ CHANGES_SUMMARY.md
❌ IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md
❌ VISUAL_GUIDE.md
❌ QUICK_REFERENCE.md
❌ Any file that documents work you just completed

## Exceptions - What IS Allowed
✅ Technical documentation that is part of the codebase (API docs, README updates, etc.) when relevant to the task
✅ User-facing guides that help users USE the feature (e.g., MOBILE_MESSAGING_GUIDE.md for setup instructions)
✅ Configuration files and code comments
✅ Documentation that existed before and needs updating

## Rule of Thumb
If the file is about "what I just did" → DON'T CREATE IT
If the file is about "how users do something" → OK to create if relevant
